Data -> INF!

1 VM = 2 numbers!

1, 2, 3 -> 2 machines!

SUM of all numbers!

M1-> 1,2  = 3     ———replication—— M3-> 1,2
M2-> 3	= 3											M4-> 3
M1+m2 = 3 + 3 = 6 = 1+2+3

SHARDING 

M1-> 1,2     = 3
M2-> 2,3           = 5      
M3-> 3,1 = 4

1 + 2 + 3 = 12


Project-> 5 VPCs!

-> always 1 Default VPC!
	-> this VPC is required otherwise we can’t even create VMs!

best case??-> NOT!

Production-> 1st thing we do-> is delete the default VPC!
	-> either Auto or Custom VPC!

3 VPCs:
1. Default-> SSH and RDP -> always allowed!
                    1. should be deleted unless for dev/test purposes!
                    2. by default the VPC is available in all regions
                            1. if you want to disable a particular region, that’s not possible!
2. Auto
            1. bare minimum VPC for you with only load balancer and internal communication allowed
            2. All the regions will contain the subnet!
            3. Used when all the regions should contain your VMs or for global distribution
3. Custom VPC
            1. bare minimum VPC for you with only load balancer and internal communication allowed
            2. You decide the region containing SUBNETS!
            3. Used when you need to control the availability regions!




Load Balancers:

DoS/DDoS: 
	HTTPS (External) or SSL Proxy

incoming-> from internet

TCP Proxy, Internal and Regional 

GCP Networking:

Network-> Global
Subnet -> Regional
Devices/VM-> Zonal!


Low latency, private IP-> Interconnect!

private IP, latency not a problem, monitoring, backup to interconnect-> IPSec Cloud VPN

public IP address, NO private IP access, no WWW internet, access to GCP private services (GSuite, Gmail, youtube…), -> Network Peering
